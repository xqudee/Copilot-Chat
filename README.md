# Copilot Chat with Gemini API integration

This project is a frontend implementation of a chat interface integrated with the Gemini API. It allows users to interact with a chatbot, send messages, receive responses with typing animations, and perform various actions such as liking, disliking, copying messages, and accessing a menu for further interactions.

## ! Note on Gemini API Usage
Please note that if you encounter errors while using the Gemini API, such as inability to connect or receive responses, it might be due to regional restrictions. Gemini API might not be available in all regions, and in such cases, you may need to use a VPN service to connect from a supported region, such as the USA or other countries where Gemini API is available.
